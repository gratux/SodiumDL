## FAQ

### What's with the name?
The name of this project is a pun on Monosodium Glutamate (E621), a common flavor enhancer.

### Why does this exist?
In my other projects I needed some way of getting multiple images from e621.net and e926.net.
Although there already were multiple libraries available, I wasn't really happy with any of them.

So I went ahead and made a new one. ([relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/927/))

### There is no clear update schedule. Why is that?
I created this library primarily for use in my other projects.
As a result, I only add or change features to suite my personal needs.
